        React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
        Key features include:
        - **Component-Based**: UI is built using reusable components.
        - **Virtual DOM**: Enhances performance by minimizing real DOM manipulation.
        - **JSX**: A syntax extension that allows mixing HTML with JavaScript.
        - **State Management**: Local state management within components.
        - **Routing**: React Router enables navigation in single-page applications.

      title: "Go (Golang)",
      content: `
        Go, or Golang, is a statically typed programming language developed by Google. 
        Key features include:
        - **Concurrency**: Supports concurrent programming with goroutines.
        - **Simplicity**: Minimalistic syntax for ease of use.
        - **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management.
        - **Rich Standard Library**: Extensive built-in functions for various tasks.
        - **Fast Compilation**: Quickly compiles code, enhancing development speed.

      title: "React Hooks",
      content: `
        Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without classes. 
        Key hooks include:
        - **useState**: For managing component state.
        - **useEffect**: For handling side effects in functional components.
        - **useContext**: For accessing context without props drilling.
        - **Custom Hooks**: Create reusable hooks for shared logic.
        - **useReducer**: For more complex state management.

      title: "Go Interfaces",
      content: `
        Interfaces in Go define a set of methods. 
        Key aspects include:
        - **Type Abstraction**: Enables polymorphism.
        - **No Explicit Declaration**: Types implement interfaces implicitly.
        - **Lightweight**: Interfaces help keep the code clean and concise.
        - **Multiple Implementations**: One interface can have multiple type implementations.
        - **Error Handling**: Often used in error handling patterns.

      title: "React Lifecycle Methods",
      content: `
        Lifecycle methods allow you to run code at specific points in a component's life. 
        Key methods include:
        - **componentDidMount**: Invoked after component is mounted.
        - **componentDidUpdate**: Invoked after updates.
        - **componentWillUnmount**: Cleanup before component is removed.
        - **shouldComponentUpdate**: Determines if a component should re-render.
        - **getDerivedStateFromProps**: Syncs state with props changes.

      title: "Go Concurrency",
      content: `
        Goâ€™s concurrency model is based on goroutines and channels. 
        Key points include:
        - **Goroutines**: Lightweight threads managed by Go.
        - **Channels**: Communicate between goroutines.
        - **Select Statement**: Allows waiting on multiple channel operations.
        - **Synchronization**: Built-in mechanisms to avoid race conditions.
        - **Performance**: Efficient concurrent execution.

      title: "React Context API",
      content: `
        Context API is used for state management across components without prop drilling. 
        Key features include:
        - **Provider**: Supplies context values to child components.
        - **Consumer**: Accesses context values in components.
        - **createContext**: Function to create a context.
        - **useContext Hook**: For functional components to consume context.
        - **Global State Management**: Simplifies managing global states.
